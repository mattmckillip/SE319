<!-- 
  THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXAMPLE IS TO SHOW TWO THINGS:
  a) The order in which js scripts are run and pages are rendered
  b) understand local and global variables in js

  Note that the onload action happens after all external files have been
  loaded. Rendering of html is usually stopped until js scripts are
  executed. Rendering can occur when all of html parsed.

  Note that although use of var for a variable may occur AFTER a use of
  the variable - it is STILL considered a LOCAL variable.
  Take the example of i in function test(). It is set to 3, and then
  a var is used. It is a local variable and the print of i OUTSIDE test
  shows 2 (the global variable result).

// TODO: IT IS FUN TO TRY TO MAKE A LIST OF WHAT WILL GET SHOWN ON
// SCREEN AND IN WHAT ORDER.
// FIGURE OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING.

// Alert "In head: 1" - first call in this very first script
// Alert "script1: value of i before test() run: 1" - js run before html rendered
// Alert "inside test method: test called before test declared" - occurs in first script
// Alert "inside test method: k is undefined" - k not defined until script 2
// Alert "inside test method: i is (a local variable) 5" - local to test method
// Alert "inside test method: before return k is 2" - local k
// Alert "script1: value of i after test() run: 1" - outside of test method
// Alert "script1: value of j after test() run: 4" - only j available in test method 
// "Hello 1!" and "Hello 2!" printed - html rendered after script 1 run
// Alert "script2: i is 1" - outside of test method
// Cannot call k=k+1 - k not defined
// "Hello 3!" printed - html rendered after 2nd js script run
// Alert "inside test method: test called after load completed!" - onload call
// Alert "inside test method: k is undefined" - k not defined until for loop
// Alert "inside test method: i is (a local variable) 5" - again returns local i
// Alert "inside test method: before return k is 2" - local k from for loop
