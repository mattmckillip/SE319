document.write(y(1) + "<br>"); //it will print the substring starting at 1 of "SamIam". so "amIam"
document.write(x(5) + "<br>"); //it will print the substring starting at 5 of "Tom Thumb". so "humb"
document.write(y(5) + "<br>"); //it will print the substring starting at 5 of "SamIam". so "m"

// Note that function createThis has exited a long time back.
// Its local variables and arguments are gone
//
// The function returned by createThis is a CLOSURE.
// It includes the code + the environment that it was created in
// That environment includes the local variable NAME whose value was
// set at the time of calling createThis function.
