<!-- 
  THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXAMPLE IS TO SHOW HOW FUNCTION DECLARATION
  HOISTING WORKS.

  ALSO, NOTE HOW FUNCTION EXPRESSION DECLARATIONS CAN BE USED IN
  EVENT HANDLERS (because they are executed AFTER the function
  expressions are executed - although physically they may be placed
  after the use in event handlers).

  ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT IF HTML IS RENDERED BEFORE JS HAS
  EXECUTED  AND IF SOMEONE CLICKS ON THE BUTTON - nothing will happen.

<body>
<input type="button" value="ClickMe" onclick="sub(100,20);" />

<script> 

// FUNCTION DECLARATION HOISTING  

// WHY DOES THIS WORK? FUNCTION DECLARATION HOISTING!
document.write("<h1> using add() before declaring it "
                    + add(10,20) + "</h1><br>");

// WAY ONE: FUNCTION DECLARATION
function add (num1, num2) { return num1 + num2; }


// ERROR
// TODO: UNCOMMENT THE NEXT LINE. DOES THIS WORK? WHY?
// sub(10,20);
// This does not work because the sub variable has not yet been declared.

// WAY TWO: FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS
var sub = function(num1, num2) {
   document.write("<h1> sub  "+ (num1 -  num2) + "</h1><br>");
}

// TODO: CLICK ON CLICKME button - see how sub indeed works
// The event handler  was able to execute the sub function to print "sub 80"

// TODO: UNCOMMENT THE NEXT LINE. DOES THIS WORK? WHY?
// sub(10,20);
// Yes, this works because the sub variable is initialized at this point in the script.
